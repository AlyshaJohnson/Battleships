# Battleships

Purpose:

Aim:

![Responsive Mockup](<directory to image>)

## 1. Design and Development

For the design of this <application>, the 5 pillars of User Experience Design (UXD) were used to cover the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface to make sure the design is intuitive, simple and enjoyable.

### 1.1 Strategy

The target user audience…

Interviews and workshops with users and stakeholders were conducted to understand their requirements and perspectives.

Research was conducted …

### 1.2 Scope

From the research and interviews conducted with the target audience and stakeholders, user stories were created to determine the flow of the app. The focus was put on the following user stories:

![User Stories 1 - 3](<insert image location>)
![User Stories 4 - 5](<insert image location>)

### 1.3 Structure

From the user stories, content, data, features and functionality can be determined.

**For the content:**


**For the data:**


**For the features / functionality:**


### 1.4 Skeleton

When the structure of the app, information and features had been determined, a wireframe for each view could be created:

<insert view of app/website>

### 1.5 Surface

**Colour Palette**

Colour was added to certain key elements to highlight them and improve the user experience in the game.

- Instructions - 
- When a battleship was hit
- Ship count for computer and player

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Existing Features

The features deployed for this quiz are as follows:

<insert feature descriptions and images>

### 2.2 Future Features

In addition to the features deployed, some features that could be deployed in a future release are:
- Coin toss to determine which user fires a missile first - this could be done by using the randint(0, 1), where 0 is heads and 1 is tails, against a user input or heads or tails to go first.
- 

## 3. Technologies Used

Several technologies were used to aid the project:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Python is the core programming language used to write all of the code in this game to make it fully functional.
    - In addition, the following Python modules were used :
        - [Colored](https://pypi.org/project/colored/)
            - Used to add colours to the printed terminal messages
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Used as the development environment.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
    - Used to deploy the game.
- [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/dashboard)
    - Used to create the flowchart for the project.
- [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/)
    - Used to test my code for any issues or errors.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Initial Developer Testing

As the project was developed and coded, developer testing was conducted to reduce the impact of bugs and errors in the code. This testing consisted of general debugging of written code based off gitpod IDE recommendations; running through input validator testing scenarios to check for input errors; and testing on different browsers.

**General Debugging**

Throughout the development, errors occurred when writing code due to the existance of white space, function name recommendations, etc. which were generated by gitpod IDE. While most of these were simple fixes and amended quickly, there are a total of 20 problems (13 red, 7 amber)that have been left in the code for the following reasons:
- 13 problems relating to code line being too long, these are ignored
- 'Invalid assignment to self in method' needs to occur in order to create a list
- 2 'Used variable 'value'' which needs to be included as looping through a dictionary which require key, value pairs
- 4 'Using the global statement' which is required to call and alter global variables

**Input Validator Testing**

The input validator testing scenarios conducted to ensure input errors were captured and mitigated correctly:
- player_board_reset input out of range (e.g. 7, Nah)
- capitalisation for player_board_reset input does not return error (e.g. Y, y)
- row/column input out of range (e.g. A9, Z1 and A10)
- capitalisation of row/column input does not return error (e.g. a1, A1)
- row/column input already used
- new_game input out of range (e.g. 7, Nah)
- capitalisation for new_game input does not return error (e.g. Y, y)

**Browser and Screensize Tesing**

The development of this app was conducted on Google Chrome, therefore extensive testing was conducted on this browser. This was used as a benchmark against Firefox and Safari.

The elements of testing conducted on each browser are:
- User Experience - what does the game look like; are all elements where they are expected; is the text format presently adequately?
- Functionality - do the inputs work as expected; are out of range inputs captured; ?
- Performance - how responsive is the site?

The user experience is consistent on Chrome, Firefox. However, on Safari the app loads but a user cannot type into their input. Heroku recommend using Chrome as the browser of choice for running the application. See support documentation [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci-browser-and-user-acceptance-testing-uat/).

### 4.2 Validator Testing

Using tools such as PEP8 validator gives visibility of any code, scripts or elements that are causing any errors. The results for the site are as follows:

**Python**
- 

### 4.3 User Testing
This app has been tested by a small group of 5 users in which some feedback was captured in the design and some errors in functionality and spelling were corrected.

UI improvement suggestions:
- write instructions and welcome for someone who has never played game before
- input descriptions need to be clear to what user is inputting (e.g. name, coordinates, Y/N, etc.)
- printing computer_guess_coords as numbers instead of [letter, number]

Errors / bug fixes:
- some coordinates not printing onto player_guess_board

The improvements and fixes that were made were...

### 4.4 Unfixed Bugs

- <list unfixed bugs here>

## 5. Deployment

The ‘<insert website name>’ was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

The ‘<insert app name>’ was deployed with the help of the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
