## 1. Design and Development

For the design of this <application>, the 5 pillars of User Experience Design (UXD) were used to cover the strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface to make sure the design is intuitive, simple and enjoyable.

### 1.1 Strategy

The target user audience…

Interviews and workshops with users and stakeholders were conducted to understand their requirements and perspectives.

Research was conducted …

### 1.2 Scope

From the research and interviews conducted with the target audience and stakeholders, user stories were created to determine the flow of the app. The focus was put on the following user stories:

![User Stories 1 - 3](<insert image location>)
![User Stories 4 - 5](<insert image location>)

### 1.3 Structure

From the user stories, content, data, features and functionality can be determined.

**For the content:**


**For the data:**


**For the features / functionality:**


### 1.4 Skeleton

When the structure of the app, information and features had been determined, a wireframe for each view could be created:

<insert view of app/website>

### 1.5 Surface

**Colour Palette**

Colour was added to certain key elements to highlight them and improve the user experience in the game.

- Instructions - 
- When a battleship was hit
- Ship count for computer and player

## 2. Features

The features deployed for this quiz are as follows:

<insert feature descriptions and images>

### 2.2 Future Features

In addition to the features deployed, some features that could be deployed in a future release are:
- Coin toss to determine which user fires a missile first - this could be done by using the randint(0, 1), where 0 is heads and 1 is tails, against a user input or heads or tails to go first.
- 

## 3. Technologies Used

Several technologies were used to aid the project:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Python is the core programming language used to write all of the code in this game to make it fully functional.
    - In addition, the following Python modules were used :
        - [Colored](https://pypi.org/project/colored/)
            - Used to add colours to the printed terminal messages
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - Used to store code for the project after being pushed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
- [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - Used as the development environment.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
    - Used to deploy the game.
- [Lucid](https://lucid.app/documents#/dashboard)
    - Used to create the flowchart for the project.
- [Pep8](http://pep8online.com/)
    - Used to test my code for any issues or errors.

## 4. Testing

### 4.1 Initial Developer Testing

As the project was developed and coded, developer testing was conducted to reduce the impact of bugs and errors in the code. This testing consisted of general debugging of written code based off gitpod IDE recommendations; running through input validator testing scenarios to check for input errors; and testing on different browsers.

**General Debugging**

Throughout the development, errors occurred when writing code due to the existance of white space, function name recommendations, etc. which were generated by gitpod IDE. While most of these were simple fixes and amended quickly, there are a total of 20 problems (13 red, 7 amber)that have been left in the code for the following reasons:
- 13 problems relating to code line being too long, these are ignored
- 'Invalid assignment to self in method' needs to occur in order to create a list
- 2 'Used variable 'value'' which needs to be included as looping through a dictionary which require key, value pairs
- 4 'Using the global statement' which is required to call and alter global variables

**Input Validator Testing**

The input validator testing scenarios conducted to ensure input errors were captured and mitigated correctly:
- player_board_reset input out of range (e.g. 7, Nah)
- capitalisation for player_board_reset input does not return error (e.g. Y, y)
- row/column input out of range (e.g. A9, Z1 and A10)
- capitalisation of row/column input does not return error (e.g. a1, A1)
- row/column input already used
- new_game input out of range (e.g. 7, Nah)
- capitalisation for new_game input does not return error (e.g. Y, y)

**Browser and Screensize Tesing**

The development of this app was conducted on Google Chrome, therefore extensive testing was conducted on this browser. This was used as a benchmark against Firefox and Safari.

The elements of testing conducted on each browser are:
- User Experience - what does the game look like; are all elements where they are expected; is the text format presently adequately?
- Functionality - do the inputs work as expected; are out of range inputs captured; ?
- Performance - how responsive is the site?

The user experience is consistent on Chrome, Firefox. However, on Safari the app loads but a user cannot type into their input. Heroku recommend using Chrome as the browser of choice for running the application. See support documentation [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci-browser-and-user-acceptance-testing-uat/).

### 4.2 Validator Testing

Using tools such as PEP8 validator gives visibility of any code, scripts or elements that are causing any errors. The results for the site are as follows:

**Python**
- 

### 4.3 User Testing
This app has been tested by a small group of 5 users in which some feedback was captured in the design and some errors in functionality and spelling were corrected.

UI improvement suggestions:
- write instructions and welcome for someone who has never played game before
- input descriptions need to be clear to what user is inputting (e.g. name, coordinates, Y/N, etc.)
- printing computer_guess_coords as numbers instead of [letter, number]

Errors / bug fixes:
- some coordinates not printing onto player_guess_board

The improvements and fixes that were made were...

## 5. Deployment

The master branch of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

### 5.1 Using Github & Gitpod

To deploy this command-line interface application, the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) was used, as this enables the application to be properly viewed on Heroku using a mock terminal. 

- Click the `Use This Template` button.
- Add a repository name and brief description.
- Click the `Create Repository from Template` to create your repository.
- To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click `Gitpod`, this can take a few minutes.
- When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.
-  Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
    - `git add .`: adds all modified files to a staging area
    - `git commit -m "A message explaining your commit"`: commits all changes to a local repository.
    - `git push`: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

To make changes to a repository without affecting it, a copy can be be made by 'Forking' it. This ensures the original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button (under account)
3. The repository has now been 'Forked' and a copy has been made

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning a repository will allow a local version of the repository to be downloaded and worked on. Cloning is also be a great way to backup work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & select the directory location where the clone is to be created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & then paste the link copied in GitHub
6. Press enter and a local clone will be created.

### 5.2 Creating an Application with Heroku

Following the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial:

- The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed. Int he instance of this project, no requirements were created as there were no project dependencies.

1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in; create an account if needed.
2. Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name for the new project - all Heroku apps need to have a unique name.
4. Select the region.

*Heroku Settings*
Environment Variables need to be set up - this is a key step to ensuring the application is deployed properly.
- In the Settings tab, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:
    - If using credentials they will need to be added as a variable, the key is the name 'CREDS' and the value is the contents of the creds JSON
    - Add key: `PORT` & value `8000`
- Buildpacks are also required for proper deployment, simply click `Add buildpack` and search for the ones required.
    - For this project, `Python` and `Node.js` were needed, in this order.

*Heroku Deployment*
In the Deploy tab:
1. Connect the Heroku account to the Github Repository following these steps:
    1. Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    2. Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    3. Choose the correct repository for the application and click on `Connect`.
2. A choice is given to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time a change is pushed to Github, whereas manual deployment requires the `Deploy Branch` button to be pushed whenever a change is made.
3. Once the deployment method has been chosen, the application will be built and can be opened using the `Open App` button at the top of the page:
